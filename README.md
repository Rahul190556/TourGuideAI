# TourGuideAI

**TourGuideAI** is an AI-powered travel assistant that helps you plan the perfect trip based on your preferences. It provides hotel and itinerary recommendations tailored to your travel details, including your destination, trip duration, budget, and travel companions. Powered by **Gemini AI**, it suggests personalized travel plans and integrates **OpenStreetMap** for showing hotel locations and places of interest, along with real-time hotel prices and ratings. Additionally, it uses **Firebase** to save user preferences and trip details for future reference.

## Features

- **AI-powered Recommendations**: Uses Gemini AI to generate customized hotel suggestions and an itinerary based on:
  - Destination choice
  - Number of days planned for the trip
  - Budget
  - Travel companions (solo, family, group, etc.)

- **Map Integration**: Displays hotels and places on an interactive map powered by **OpenStreetMap**, giving users a visual guide of nearby attractions and hotels.

- **Hotel Prices & Ratings**: Provides up-to-date hotel prices and ratings to help you choose the best options according to your preferences.

- **Itinerary Suggestions**: Based on your trip duration and preferences, it offers suggested itineraries for places to visit and activities to do during your stay.

- **Firebase Integration**: Saves user trip details, preferences, and recommendations in **Firebase** for easy access and future reference.

## Technologies Used
